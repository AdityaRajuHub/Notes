REST
----

Representational State Transfer: is transferring the state of an object over the internet to the client.
The state of an object can be represented using JSON format.

So when a browser requests a server for data, server responds with a web page. But what if an app requests data and it can't interpret a webpage
in that case we need to transer state in the form of XML/JSON
