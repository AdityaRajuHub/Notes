Maven
-----

Dependency element tells Maven to do the following:

1. Create a search path based on the groupId, artifactId, and version. The
version element is set to the camel-version property, which is defined in the
POM referenced in the parent element, and resolves to 2.20.1. The type of
dependency isn’t specified, so the JAR file type is assumed. 
The search path is org/apache/camel/camel-core/2.20.1/camel-core-2.20.1.jar.

2. Because listing 1.3 defines no special places for Maven to look for the Camel
dependencies, it looks in Maven’s central repository, located at
http://repo1.maven.org/maven2.

3. Combining the search path and the repository URL, Maven tries to download
http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/camel/camelcore/2.20.1/camel-core-2.20.1.jar.

4. This JAR is saved to Maven’s local download cache, which is typically located
in the home directory under the .m2/repository. This is ~/.m2/repository on
Linux/macOS, and C:\Users\<Username>\.m2\repository on recent versions
of Windows.

5. When the application code in listing 1.2 is started, the Camel JAR is added to
the classpath.
To run the example in listing 1.2, change to the chapter1/file-copy directory
and use the following command:

mvn compile exec:java

This instructs Maven to compile the source in the src directory and to 
execute the FileCopierWithCamel class with the camel-core JAR on the
classpath.
